\section{Usability}
\label{chapter:objective-usability}

Clustering data on maps not only affects performance, it also changes the way, the user will see and interact with the clustered data. Ideally, the clustering process should support the user in the task of exploring a large data set on the map by compacting the amount of information that is visualized. The way, how the clustered data is visualized on the map needs to communicate essential information about the clustered data like the size of a cluster. In addition, the user needs means of interacting with the clustered data being presented. The user should be able to reveal the details of clustered data for example by zooming in.
